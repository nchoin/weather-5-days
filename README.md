# The Five Day Weather Forecast
Get a 5 day weather forecast by searching by city name

## Description
We all look for weather apps to check the forecast weather we are staying home or traveling. This weather app searches for the weather by city. It will show you the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. You will the current forecast as well as the next five days. 

I gained a better understanding of using APIs to gather data for programming.

## Credits
Thank you to the following people who helped me think through my code, answered my questions and offered suggestions:  

#### UConn BootCamp Instructors:  

  - [Lee Warrick](https://github.com/mynar7) - editing http to https in APIs
  - [Mia Ciasullo](https://github.com/miacias) - JS functionality

#### Tutor:
  - John Titus - setting up APIs using data from another API
  - Ethan from CodeNinjas - worked with me to create a function to clear previous weather results

I used the following videos to gather more informationa about understanding creating weather apps. 

Information including a video for and example of how to [design HTML and CSS for a weather app](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/weather-app-project-html-javascript/).
